It refers to the ability of a compound to dissolve in a solvent, typically water. Understanding solubility is essential because it impacts various aspects of chemical research and development, such as drug formulation, environmental impact assessment, and material science.\n","\n","## Data Source\n","\n","The data for this project was collected from the ChEMBL website, a prominent repository of bioactive molecules. The dataset used here contains information on organic compounds, including their molecular properties and solubility. As of the last update in January 2023, the dataset comprises an impressive 2,354,965 compounds.\n","\n","## Data Preparation\n","\n","The dataset underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure its reliability and usability. This cleaning process involved several steps, such as:\n","\n","- Handling missing values: NaN values were removed or imputed.\n","- Data type conversion: Certain columns were converted to the appropriate numeric format.\n","- Removal of duplicates: Duplicate entries were identified and eliminated.\n","\n","These cleaning steps were essential to prepare the data for accurate and meaningful solubility predictions.\n","\n","## AlogP and Its Significance\n","\n","One of the key molecular properties used in solubility prediction is AlogP, or the logarithm of the partition coefficient. AlogP measures the lipophilicity of a compound, indicating how well it can partition between an organic solvent and water. \n","\n","In simpler terms, AlogP helps us understand whether a compound prefers to dissolve in a non-polar environment (like oil) or a polar environment (like water). Compounds with higher AlogP values are typically less soluble in water, while those with lower values are more water-soluble.\n","\n","## Model Training\n","\n","A linear regression model was trained using the prepared data. The model was trained with the following specifications:\n","\n","- Number of training epochs: 100,000\n","- Learning rate: 0.00001\n","- Evaluation metric: Mean squared error (L2 loss)\n","\n","Throughout the training process, the model's performance improved gradually. As an illustration, at Epoch 90000, the training L2 loss was observed to be 0.605. This indicates that the model was converging toward a lower loss value, suggesting improved predictive capabilities.\n","\n","\n","## Predicting AlogP\n","\n","This project includes the functionality to predict AlogP for a given set of molecular properties. Users can input the feature values for a molecule, and the trained model will provide the predicted AlogP value.\n","\n","## Interpretation\n","\n","Interpreting the AlogP prediction is essential. Here's a simple guideline:\n","\n","- Positive AlogP: Indicates a compound is more hydrophobic and has a greater affinity for the organic phase.\n","- Negative AlogP: Suggests a compound is more hydrophilic and prefers the aqueous phase.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","Understanding and predicting solubility, especially in the context of AlogP, is vital for various scientific and industrial applications. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions about the solubility of organic compounds, contributing to advancements in drug discovery, environmental science, and material design.\n","\n","The combination of data cleaning, feature selection, and model training demonstrates a structured approach to tackling real-world challenges in chemistry and data science.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"82527d5d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-07T17:42:18.348167Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-07T17:42:18.347485Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.751043Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.749985Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.41139,"end_time":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.753742","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-07-07T17:42:18.342352","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.23.5\n","  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n"]}],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd \n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score\n","import joblib"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"4ed5eb3e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.763013Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.762652Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-07T17:42:45.046332Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-07T17:42:45.045059Z"},"papermill":{"duration":25.291734,"end_time":"2025-07-07T17:42:45.049465","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-07-07T17:42:19.757731","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipykernel_20/4187779942.py:2: DtypeWarning: Columns (27) have mixed types.
